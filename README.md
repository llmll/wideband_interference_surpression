# wideband_interference_surpression
these maltab codes  were algorithm   simulations    about  wideband interference surpression    which  power  is  100dB  large  than  signals .these  used  for  spread  spectrum   such   as  GPS , GLONASS ,COMPASS (BD-2  CHINA) . algorithm  content such as   STAP etc
